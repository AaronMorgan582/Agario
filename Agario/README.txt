    B) Branching

       ListToDictionaryConversion: We were initially using a List to keep track of the Circles in the Client_and_GUI. After some experimentation and analysis,
       we decided to try to utilize a Dictionary instead for storage purposes. We started a new branch called "MovementTest" to begin working on it (we worked
       on it together), but we realized it wasn't really working.

       Aaron wanted to see if he could get it to work correctly, but forgot to pull from Git, and ended up making an entirely new branch. The branch included
       the changes to the World class to get the Dictionary to work correctly in the Client_and_GUI class.
