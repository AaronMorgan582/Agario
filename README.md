# Agario

This repository contains the C# code for an Agario game that was created by Aaron Morgan and Xavier Davis in the Spring 2020 term.

The assignment was intended to teach concepts of not only game building, but communication between networks and servers.

Unfortunately the game does not fully work, as we ran into some issues removing circles from the screen.
